/**
 * Central facade class for interacting with Moo to do mapping from objects to objects. Much of the
 * capability of the framework can be exercised at this level without ever delving into many of the
 * classes within.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also serves as a long-term cache for anything that can be cached between invocations, things that
 * aren't session-specific, although these caches survive only as long as your instance of Moo,
 * which might be almost exactly as long as the session in many cases.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Alternately, you might find working directly with {@link Translate} and {@link Update} more to
 * your taste.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some simple examples of Moo in action:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Moo.translate( UserDto.class ).from( currentUser );</li>
 * <li>Moo.translate( UserDto.class ).fromEach( activeUsers );</li>
 * <li>Moo.translate( currentUser, UserDto.class );</li>
 * <li>Moo.translate( activeUsers, UserDto.class );</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Moo supports a limited amount of configuration through annotations, in particular
 * {@link com.codiform.moo.annotation.Property}, {@link com.codiform.moo.annotation.MapProperty},
 * {@link com.codiform.moo.annotation.CollectionProperty} and {@link com.codiform.moo.annotation.Ignore}
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Instances of Moo are intended to be typesafe, they can be used by more than one thread at once
 * without an issue, and can be cached and re-used.
 * </p>
